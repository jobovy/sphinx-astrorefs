    "## About\n",
    "\n",
    "``sphinx-astrorefs`` is a [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) extension for formatting citations and references in a style similar to that used in the astrophysics literature. It is built on top of [sphinxcontrib-bibtex](https://sphinxcontrib-bibtex.readthedocs.io), a Sphinx extension for including ``bibtex`` citations in Sphinx documents. By pre- and post-processing the input and output from Sphinx and ``sphinxcontrib-bibtex``, ``sphinx-astrorefs`` allows you to obtain citations in the astro-specific style in the HTML and LaTeX rendering of your Sphinx documents."

    "extensions= ['sphinxcontrib.bibtex','sphinx_astrorefs']\n",

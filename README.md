``sphinx-astrorefs`` is a Sphinx extension for formatting citations and references in a style similar to that used in the astrophysics literature. It is built on top of [sphinxcontrib-bibtex](https://github.com/mcmtroffaes/sphinxcontrib-bibtex), a Sphinx extension for including bibtex citations in Sphinx documents. By pre- and post-processing the input and output from Sphinx and sphinxcontrib-bibtex, ``sphinx-astrorefs`` allows you to obtain citations in the astro-specific style in the HTML and LaTeX rendering of your Sphinx documents.

## Changelog

* **2020/08/09**: Version 0.3: Fixes a minor bug in 0.2 that caused multiple \citealt-style citations in a single line be parsed incorrectly. All reference replacements are now done one at a time, so multi-citation lines should now be handled correctly for all citation types.
* **2020/07/22**: Version 0.2: Removes printing the Sphinx builder's name and makes the bibtex label invisible in the HTML reference section without removing the element entirely and thus removing the id link, thus fixing the HTML rendering of the reference section.
* **2020/07/01**: Version 0.1.

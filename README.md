``sphinx-astrorefs`` is a Sphinx extension for formatting citations and references in a style similar to that used in the astrophysics literature. It is built on top of [sphinxcontrib-bibtex](https://github.com/mcmtroffaes/sphinxcontrib-bibtex), a Sphinx extension for including bibtex citations in Sphinx documents. By pre- and post-processing the input and output from Sphinx and sphinxcontrib-bibtex, ``sphinx-astrorefs`` allows you to obtain citations in the astro-specific style in the HTML and LaTeX rendering of your Sphinx documents.
